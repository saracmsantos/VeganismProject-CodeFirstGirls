            <h3>How your diet could change the world</h3>
            <p>While the world's population has doubled since the 1960s, world meat production has quadrupled. In certain areas, livestock production has increased massively; there are now 4 and a half times as many tonnes of pig produced in 2013 compared to 1961, while world chicken production has increased by nearly 13 times.</p>
            <p> This trend will continue to contribute to global warming, widespread pollution, deforestation, land degradation, water scarcity and species extinction. More animals mean more crops are needed to feed them: the planet cannot feed both increasing human and farmed animal populations, especially when there will be between 2-4 billion more human mouths to feed by 2050.</p>

                <h3>How does veganism reduce deforestation?</h3>
                <p>It takes a lot of land to meet global demand for meat. About one-third of the Earth's landmass is dedicated to raising animals for consumption. The meat industry clears millions of acres of forested land to make room to graze cattle and grow crops for animal feed. This process, known as deforestation, releases stored carbon from forests into the atmosphere, exacerbating our climate crisis even further.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, plant-based meat alternatives don't require nearly as much land to produce. In fact, the Good Food Institute estimates that plant-based meat uses up to 99% less land than conventional meat. If the whole world shifted toward plant-based diets, we could save up to 75% of global farmland. </p>

                <h3>How does veganism save water?</h3>
                <p>Agriculture consumes more water than any other major global industry, accounting for 70% of global water use. A study published in Water Resources Research estimates that 41% of the water used for agriculture goes toward growing livestock feed for the meat industry.</p>

                <p>We can save a significant amount of water by ditching meat products and making the switch to plant-based foods. In fact, switching to a vegan diet reduces your individual water footprint up to 55%. Going vegan could prove essential to conserving our global freshwater supply for generations to come.</p>

                <p>If we are trying to reduce our car use, limit the amount of water we waste, become more 'energy-efficient' and generally lessen our environmental impact, we must also examine the most important factor of our personal ecological footprint: what we eat.</p>
